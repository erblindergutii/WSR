### What is this ?
If you need it! Use it even without credit.
What I tried to do here, is to create a CSS(Stylus) file where you can include without making too much changes in your current project.

Also even to edit it is very simple because of variables.

I would be happy if someone would help me on this, this would be open and free to everyone.
